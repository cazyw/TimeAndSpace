      <h3 class="page-header">Introduction</h3>
      <p>Another companion gone but not to worry because the next companion is not a completely unknown face - Donna Noble takes up the offer to travel with the Doctor. I quite liked this series and personally I liked the Tenth Doctor with Donna the best (as much as I love Rose I thought her interactions with the Ninth Doctor were better).

      <p>But first up is the Christmas Special and Kylie Minogue (as Astrid Perth) joins the Doctor on the space-Titanic (clearly they didn't get the memo on its predecessor). It's always great to have an episode with a mix of characters and aliens.</p>

      <p>The historian and Earth-guide Mr Copper (famous for <i>Keeping Up Appearances</i> provides comic relief with his explanations of Earth and Christmas customs (such as going to war with and eating Turkey).</p>

      <p>We get to meet (at this stage unknowingly) Donna's granddad Wilfred who's manning his little stall in the empty London streets (because based on the last few years, Christmas is not so much the season of joy but alien invations).</p>

      <p>A meglomaniac pays an ailing Captain to crash the Titanic (so perhaps he did know what he was doing when he named the ship) and the Doctor must band together with a small group of survivers to work out what's going on and prevent the ship from plummeting to earth.</p>

      <p>Job done but not without the loss of several brave souls. Great Christmas romp - fine cruising, London, spaceship, good and bad people, aliens, cheesy lines. Fantastic!</p>

      <h3 class="page-header">Episode 1 - Partners in Crime</h3>
      <p>Yay, the return of Donna Noble. We met Donna one year ago when she got caught up in an alien invasion during her wedding. She declined the Doctor's invitation to join him but has realised that nothing compares. Went to Egypt, did the usual tourist thing and would you know it, back at work before you know it.</p>

      <p>But she's determined to find the Doctor so she tells her star gazing grandad Wilfred to keep an eye out for a blue box (they are so sweet together) and the Donna starts snooping around anything that's weird and possibly alien because how else do you find the Doctor?!</p>

      <p>The first half is brilliant with near misses as they both investigate the same company - Adipose Industries - for the diet pills they're promoting ("The fat just walks away" - literally!). When they finally meet up in the same spot, it is classic. Miss Foster is toying with another investigative journalist when Donna peeks in through the door window and the Doctor peeks in outside from a window cleaner. They both spot each other and then begins a hilarious mime by Donna as she acts out what she's been up to, until they are caught by Miss Foster and the chase begins.</p>

      <p>The adipose (fat) are such cute little square blobs. They form from the fat in the middle of the night when people are asleep (literally walking away) but with Miss Foster caught she triggers a mass spawning of adipose and people everywhere start wriggling about as the fat blobs move inside them before popping out.</p>

      <p>Ongoing theme clue for this season - the adipose planet has disappeared</p>

      <p>It was also a relief that they acknowledge the kinda big elephant in the room and made it clear that there would be no romantic unrequieted feelings this series. The Doctor and Donna are just gonna be mates (which made for a bit of fun when Donna misheard his intentions "to mate"). </p>

      <p>The suprise at the end - the return of Rose! She's somehow made it back from Pete's World and must be trying to find the Doctor.</p>

      <p>It was also sweet that Donna's first request is to fly to the portion of the sky her grandad peers at so he gets to see her and the Doctor (who he recognises) in the blue box.</p>

      <h3 class="page-header">Episode 2 - The Fires of Pompeii</h3>
      <p>First trip for Donna and it's back in time. The Doctor never seems to get it right because they end up in Pompeii, on "volcano day" rather than Rome. This episode had lots of (for future fans) interesting moments with the actors that end up playing Amy Pond and the Twelfth Doctor making an appearance. </p>

      <p>First off the funny moments - both of them calling themselves Spartacus, Donna's attempts to speak latin (that end up apparently sounding Welsh/Celtic), Doctor Time Lord Yes vs Donna Human No. I knew Donna was going to be great because she wasn't going to take anything lying down, not even from the Doctor.</p>

      <p>But this is also where we end up seeing the dilema of a time traveller - you can't save everyone, sometimes you have to let history play out (Pompeii is a fixed point in time) which means, letting people die, not warning them of their impending doom. Donna can't let this happen. And she eventually convinces the Doctor that sure, not everyone can be saved but one family, one family can be saved.</p>

      <p>It was eye-opening for Donna as we realise that it's the Doctor who causes Pompeii. The volvano is erupting yes but not at the magnatitude history dictates. It's only then he realises the choice comes down to (1) blowing up the aliens in the volcano to save the world but lose Pompeii (2) not destroying Pompeii but leaving the world in jeaopardy. Although really when you think about it, there was never any choice but I guess by whose hands would the Pompeii citizens die.</p>

      <p>The seers saw the Doctor and Donna's past and present but also a glimpse of the future. To the Doctor - "she is returning" (a reference to Rose) and to Donna - "there is something on your back" (bizarre). It was actually kinda intense with the red mood lighting and earthquake shakes when the two seers vied to out do each other.</p>

      <p>Solid episode.</p>

      <h3 class="page-header">Episode 10 - Midnight</h3>
      <p>Wow. This was an incredibly intense episode that played on psychological fear, which is often the greatest fear of all - the fear of the unknown, of the other. I like this episode because it is so unlike other Doctor Who episodes but at the same time, the group-think and mass hysteria is really intense. And sadly quite a realistic portrayal of human nature.</p>

      <p>The Doctor and Donna visit a mysterious planet called Midnight and Donna waves off the Doctor to spend the episode at a spa. The Doctor joins a cruise across the planet surface but the transport breaks down and an unnamed and unseen entity invades the cabin and posesses one of the passengers, driving everyone absolutelyy bonkers.</p>

      <p>The ease with which fear and hysteria is whipped up is rather frightening. All it really took was one very anxious passenger to kick start the panic. You could see it happening, the one passenger who jumped immediately to the worst conclusion and then would not stop talking long enough to let logic and reason in. Ironically if everyone had simply just shut up and not talked (rather than persist in telling the passenger to shut up - which she obviously couldn't), it wouldn't have gotten so out of hand.</p>

      <p>Because this episode was all about voice. The entity first repeated everyone's speech with a slight delay, then spoke at exactly the same time as everyone. In the final phase, it stole the Doctor's voice and started speaking <i>before</i> he did, so the crowd thought that <i>he</i> was the one infected.  </p>

      <p>The Doctor was oddly powerless and all his grand speeches and clever talking came to nothing because <i>she</i> was speaking the same time he was. In a really cool (but extremely difficult to act) part, both she and the Doctor spoke the square root of pi to 30 decimal places. Bet that was a treat to film. </p>

      <p>What was frightening was that in the space of 10-15 minutes they went from a group of easy going passengers chatting with each other to a fearful and aggressive mob intent on murdering their fellow passenger and not just one but as many as it took. True, the driver and mechanic were killed off screen but there was nothing actually physically threatening them and no guarantee that chucking people into the toxic atmosphere would kill the entity. After all, that's where the entity came from in the first place. </p>

      <p>The scariest things are those that are unseen. And the most dangerous and terrifying  monsters are ourselves.  </p>
