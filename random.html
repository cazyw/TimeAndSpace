        <ol>
          <li>Vincent and The Doctor, Series 5, Episode 10 - The Doctor<p>
          "The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa, 
          the bad things don’t always spoil the good things or make them unimportant."</p></li>
          <li>Aliens of London, Series 1, Episode 2 - The Doctor<p>
          "Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world?"</p></li>
          <li>Family of Blood, Series 3, Episode 9 - Tim Latimer<p>
          "He’s like fire and ice and rage. He’s like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. He’s ancient and forever. He burns at the 
          centre of time and can see the turn of the universe. And he’s wonderful."</p></li>
          <li>Dark Water, Series 8, Episode 11 - The Doctor<p>
          "Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?"</p></li>
          <li>Death in Heaven, Series 8, Episode 12 - The Doctor<p>
          "Pain is a gift. Without the capacity for pain we can't feel the hurt we inflict."</p></li>
          <li>The Magician's Apprentice, Series 9, Episode 1 - The Doctor<p>
          "Your chances of surviving are about one in a thousand. Forget about the thousand. Concentrate on the one."</p></li>
          <li>The Magician's Apprentice, Series 9, Episode 1 - The Doctor<p>
          "...if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil to be a ruthless 
          dictator who would destroy millions of lives... could you then kill that child?"</p></li>
          <li>The Girl Who Died, Series 9, Episode 5 - The Doctor<p>
          "Ripples into tidal waves until everybody dies."</p></li>
          <li>The Girl Who Died, Series 9, Episode 5 - The Doctor<p>
          "Immortality isn't living forever. That's not what it feels like. Immortality is everybody else dying. She might meet someone she can't bear to lose. That happens. I believe."</p></li>
          <li>The Woman Who Lived, Series 9, Episode 6 - The Doctor<p>
          "I saved your life. I didn’t know that your heart would rust because I kept it beating. I didn’t think that your conscience would need renewing, that the well of human kindness would run dry. I just wanted to save a terrified young woman’s life."</p></li>
          <li>The Woman Who Lived, Series 9, Episode 6 - The Doctor<p>
          "People like us, we go on too long. We forget what matters. The last thing we need is each other. We need the mayflies. You see the mayflies, they know more than we do. They know how beautiful and precious life is because it’s fleeting."</p></li>
          <li>The Zygon Inversion, Series 9, Episode 8 - The Doctor<p>
          "You just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You’re not superior to people who were cruel to you. You’re just a whole bunch of new cruel people. A whole bunch of new cruel people being cruel to some other people who’ll end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they’re prepared to forgive. Why don’t you break the cycle?"</p></li>
          <li>The Zygon Inversion, Series 9, Episode 8 - The Doctor<p>
          "...Because, like every other tantruming child in history, Bonnie, you don’t actually know what you want. So let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you’ve killed all the bad guys, and when it’s all perfect and just and fair. When you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you gonna do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How’re you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?"</p></li>
          <li>The Zygon Inversion, Series 9, Episode 8 - The Doctor<p>
          "I don’t understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean do you call this a war? This funny little thing. This is not a war. I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you can ever imagine. And when I close my eyes… I hear more screams than anyone would ever be able to count!"</p></li>
          <li>Face the Raven, Series 9, Episode 10 - The Doctor<p>
          "You'll find it's a very small universe when I'm angry with you."</p></li>

          <li>Here’s Why Good Employees Quit - Mary Davids, LinkedIn<p>
          "Not everyone is skilled enough to manage processes or lead people. Just because someone is good at what they do does not mean 
          they will be a great manager, and that’s perfectly OK! When people who are not fit to lead are put into positions of leadership it 
          can create a catastrophic circumstance in the workplace leading to high turnover and low employee morale. So please, stop slapping 
          “Manager” on every good worker’s name and put people in those positions only if they have the characteristics necessary to influence 
          workers to execute the company vision and those willing to work together to get the job done."</p></li>
          <li>How to Make Hard Choices - Ruth Chang, TEDTalk (TEDSalon NY 2014)<p>
          "So when we face hard choices, we shouldn't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better. There is no 
          best alternative. Instead of looking for reasons out there, we should be looking for reasons in here: Who am I to be? You might decide to 
          be a pink sock-wearing, cereal-loving, country-living banker, and I might decide to be a black sock-wearing, urban, donut-loving artist. 
          What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us.</p>
          <p>Now, people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters. We all know people like that. I drifted into 
          being a lawyer. I didn't put my agency behind lawyering. I wasn't for lawyering. Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives. 
          They let mechanisms of reward and punishment -- pats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option — to determine what they do. 
          So the lesson of hard choices: reflect on what you can put your agency behind, on what you can be for, and through hard choices, 
          become that person." </p></li>
