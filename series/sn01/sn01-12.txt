Episode 12 - Bad Wolf

Bad Wolf. The very first Doctor Who episode I watched way back in 2005 and the episode that got me hooked on Doctor Who. This is also the first in the two-part series finale farewelling Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor (who was absolutely fantastic this series). In a clever melding of reality with fantasy, the episode featured The Doctor, Rose and Jack trapped in different reality TV shows (Big Brother, The Weakest Link and some fashion show that I guess we didn't have in Australia). In a funny coincidence the host of The Weakest Link in the UK was Anne Robinson and so they had an Anne-droid (android...get it?!) as the host of the show. 

The three were mysteriously teleported from the TARDIS into the reality Tv shows by unknown entities and have a lark in the games until they realise that the stakes of losing are much higher...death. Only the winners get to live. The Doctor and Jack manage to escape but Rose gets zapped right infront of them. Which puts them in a right state and hell hath no fury like the Doctor who's just lost a companion. Thankfully though, Jack figures out that the disintegrator beam that zaps contestants doesn't actually turn people to atoms but transports them. It's a teleport beam! 

But where are they being teleported and who's behind it all? Rose wakes up and we find out that she's on a dalek ship, sitting in the middle of an entire dalek fleet. They've been hiding in the dark edges of space growing and building and manipulating the Earth's history. The Doctor is incredulous and scared but he's going to do anything he can to save Rose. 

Cliffhanger!

My first episode had Earth in the future, space, a space station, daleks, reality TV, the Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack Harkness. What a fantastic introduction to Doctor Who!
