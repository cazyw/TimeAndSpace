Introduction

The ability to travel in all of time and space - what a fantastic concept for a show!

I didn't grow up with Doctor Who as the 'old' series ended in 1989, so it wasn't until the re-boot in 2005 that I got my first taste of the mad man in a blue box. The very first episode I watched was the first of the two-part series finale, 'Bad Wolf', and from then on I was hooked and went back to watch the rest of the season. 

The first season will always hold a special place in my heart, as will my first Doctor - the Ninth Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston. He was the last of his kind, the survivor of a war that had left him hardened, a tad grim and intense. You don't mess with The Doctor, the Oncoming Storm. But he was also showed a side of himself that was full of compassion, joy and laughter. I always found it incredible watching him switch from being intensely serious to grinning like a maniac in a split second. Christopher Eccleston bore the responsibility as the main protagonist of bringing Doctor Who back from obscurity and he did a fantastic job. The 21<sup>st</sup> Century needed this kind of Doctor. Having only one series (it was heartbreaking to watch him go) I think he's incredibly underrated.

The first season is one of my favourites, having in general very good storylines that weave together the alien with the familiar. Rose was the perfect character/companion to introduce us to the Doctor's world. Young and brave, she wasn't afraid to give the Doctor a piece of her mind but her compassion for people around her and her determination to do the right thing made her a brilliant companion. She's one of the few companions in the new series with a deeper backstory, as her family appears in quite a number of episodes. She was real.

It was the perfect start to travelling the universe ...
