Episode 8 - The Hungry Earth

It's the year 2020 and the Doctor's notoriously bad driving has landed the Ponds in a small mining town in Wales rather than Rio 
(funny that, the TARDIS always seems to land in Wales). Rather improbably, a small team (we only ever see three people) have drilled 
21 kilometres deep into the earth, further than anyone else has ever attempted. But what lies beneath? Turns out, not just dirt. This episode 
introduces new viewers to the Silurians, a race of lizard-like beings who lived on Earth millions of years ago but have since been hibernating in
	their city deep below the surface. The drilling by the humans threatened their safety and the Silurians are not going down without a fight. 
In fact, they plan to wipe every "stinking ape" from the face of the Earth. Both sides have hostages and with the Silurians having taken Amy, 
it's a race by the Doctor to get to the 'literal' bottom of things.

Set ten years into the future, things look pretty much exactly as they do now. In fact, future Amy and Rory have apparently decided to pop back 
here and stand waving in the distance. Weird. Although I guess there's not many opportunities to visit your past selves. 
At least they know not to cause a paradox! Travelling around in a Police Phone Box, 
I suppose it's inevitable that people will think it's the real deal. It was quite funny seeing Elliot and his mum lead Rory around thinking he was 
a real Police detective. Poor Rory looked clueless. Elliot on the other hand, although dyslexic, seemed to be a smart kid and quoted from Sherlock 
Holmes.

This episode was part one of this two-part episode and ends with Amy facing dissection at the hands of a Silurian surgeon and the Doctor realising that 
he's underestimated the extent of the Silurian remnant, with an entire city underground.
