Introduction

The ending of the 10<sup>th</sup> Doctor brought the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Not only was David Tennant handing over the 
		TARDIS to Matt Smith, Russell T Davies was handing over the reins to Steven Moffatt. A new new Doctor, a new blank slate. Don't expect any of the 
previous season's companions to be popping in and out, the Doctor's a new man, and while he never forgets, he's moved on. He must.
