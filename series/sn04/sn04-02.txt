Episode 2 - The Fires of Pompeii

First trip for Donna and it's back in time. The Doctor never seems to get it right because they end up in Pompeii, on "volcano day" rather than Rome. This episode had lots of (for future fans) interesting moments with the actors that end up playing Amy Pond and the Twelfth Doctor making an appearance. 

First off the funny moments - both of them calling themselves Spartacus, Donna's attempts to speak latin (that end up apparently sounding Welsh/Celtic), Doctor Time Lord Yes vs Donna Human No. I knew Donna was going to be great because she wasn't going to take anything lying down, not even from the Doctor.

But this is also where we end up seeing the dilema of a time traveller - you can't save everyone, sometimes you have to let history play out (Pompeii is a fixed point in time) which means, letting people die, not warning them of their impending doom. Donna can't let this happen. And she eventually convinces the Doctor that sure, not everyone can be saved but one family, one family can be saved.

It was eye-opening for Donna as we realise that it's the Doctor who causes Pompeii. The volvano is erupting yes but not at the magnatitude history dictates. It's only then he realises the choice comes down to (1) blowing up the aliens in the volcano to save the world but lose Pompeii (2) not destroying Pompeii but leaving the world in jeaopardy. Although really when you think about it, there was never any choice but I guess by whose hands would the Pompeii citizens die.

The seers saw the Doctor and Donna's past and present but also a glimpse of the future. To the Doctor - "she is returning" (a reference to Rose) and to Donna - "there is something on your back" (bizarre). It was actually kinda intense with the red mood lighting and earthquake shakes when the two seers vied to out do each other.

Solid episode.
