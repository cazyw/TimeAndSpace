Introduction

Another companion gone but not to worry because the next companion is not a completely unknown face - Donna Noble takes up the offer to travel with the Doctor. I quite liked this series and personally I liked the Tenth Doctor with Donna the best (as much as I love Rose I thought her interactions with the Ninth Doctor were better).
