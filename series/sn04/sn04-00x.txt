Christmas Special - Voyage of the Damned

But first up is the Christmas Special and Kylie Minogue (as Astrid Perth) joins the Doctor on the space-Titanic (clearly they didn't get the memo on its predecessor). It's always great to have an episode with a mix of characters and aliens.

The historian and Earth-guide Mr Copper (famous for <i>Keeping Up Appearances</i> provides comic relief with his explanations of Earth and Christmas customs (such as going to war with and eating Turkey).

We get to meet (at this stage unknowingly) Donna's granddad Wilfred who's manning his little stall in the empty London streets (because based on the last few years, Christmas is not so much the season of joy but alien invations).

A meglomaniac pays an ailing Captain to crash the Titanic (so perhaps he did know what he was doing when he named the ship) and the Doctor must band together with a small group of survivers to work out what's going on and prevent the ship from plummeting to earth.

Job done but not without the loss of several brave souls. Great Christmas romp - fine cruising, London, spaceship, good and bad people, aliens, cheesy lines. Fantastic!
