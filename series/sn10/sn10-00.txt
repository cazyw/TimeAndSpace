Introduction

There was no Doctor Who regular season in 2016 which left a gap between the last Christmas special and this one. The 2017 season will in some ways be a fresh break - no Clara and having wrapped up River's story - it feels like such a long time ago since those stories ended. We'll have Nardole as some continuation to link the past with the future but it'll be interesting to see how the new companion (Billie) fits in. Looking forward to what will (sadly) probably be the 12th Doctor's last series.
