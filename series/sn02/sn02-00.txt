Introduction

Series 2 brought a new Doctor the the form of David Tennant and the last regular series for Billie Piper's Rose. I found it a bit of a mix with good and not so good episodes and while I do love the Tenth Doctor and Rose, I thought the dynamic was a little less fraught with tension last series compared to this one.
