Episode 12 - The Sound of Drums

The Prime Minister of the UK is the Master under the guise of Harold Saxon. This was nicely sprinkled throughout the series (even in the series 2) with posters of "Vote Saxon" in the background of several episodes. 

The Doctor wasn't able to stop the Master from stealing his TARDIS but he was able to lock his destination. And he's back on Earth in the present (four earth days after Martha joined the Doctor) having slowly over the last 18 months worked his way up to Prime Minister. Even Martha voted for him! He's managed to, through the mobile phone network, hypnotised everyone into trusting him.

But now the trio are on the run and Martha's family has been taken into custody. It's not clear what the Master's plans are (except maybe taking over the world) but he's brought some murderous alien friends with him. He is in a word - bonkers. In a psycopathic way. And the Doctor it seems, is powerless to stop him, made prisoner while Marth manages to escape to set the Doctor's plan in motion.

Cool makeup effect - seeing the Doctor physically age about 135 years old.
