Introduction

So with the loss of Rose, the Doctor picks up a new companion this series with Martha - a student studying to be a doctor (of the medical kind).
 It was hard, having just changed to a new Doctor last year to then change companions, and Martha sometimes gets the short end of the stick when 
it comes to companions (the Doctor still mourning the loss of Rose). But she's smart, she's got guts and the Doctor needs her.
