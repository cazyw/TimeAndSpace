Episode 11 - Utopia

Captain Jack, Captain Jack is back. After being left on a space station at the end of series 1, Jack finally gets to confront the Doctor about being abandoned and find out why he cannot die. It was great hearing about what Jack's been up to and the Doctor's reasons for running away (okay, so he was dying and regenerating but we never heard a peep about Jack afterwards when everything had settled down).

Turns out Jack's a time anomoly and the Doctor cannot stand it. Neither it seems can the TARDIS which tries to shake Jack off and travel to the end of the universe. Here the remaining survivors of the human race attempt to travel to 'Utopia' to escape the futurekind (which look like humans with pointy teeth). 

It was an episode of callbacks - Jack had the Doctor's hand from the Sycorax invasion, Jack himself, Torchwood, Canary Wharf, the chameleon arch. 

This episode also introduced at the very very end the Master. Another Time Lord and the Doctor's...frenemy. Looking forward to seeing how the Doctor interacts with another Time Lord, someone his equal and a little bit of a crazy genius. And having stolen the TARDIS, the Master's definitely got the upper hand. This episode sets up the two-part series finale.
