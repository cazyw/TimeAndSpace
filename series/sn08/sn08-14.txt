Concluding Thoughts

And here ends Peter Capaldi's first year as The Doctor. I had my doubts but the Twelth Doctor is growing on me. After the exuberence and 
bouncing energy of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors (which sometimes was ridiculously over-the-top), it's been refreshing to see a Doctor who 
feels the weight of his 2000+ years and is a little grittier and harder because of it. You live this long, sure you may have accomplished great things
but you've also probably made many mistakes and had many regrets. This Doctor's understated and dry sense of humour when dealing with people
is a hoot. That said, I thought Kill the Moon was a low point and I did not like The Doctor in this episode as I felt he was quite mean. 
For me, the season was a mix of highs and lows. Some great episodes with interesting characters and plots (and the return of The Master in 
fabulous form). But I thought there was also a bit too much focus on Clara and the constant in-your-face references to The Promised Land 
were annoying. Overall, a decent transition for a new Doctor.
