Christmas Special - Last Christmas	

Have you ever woken from a dream only to realise you're still dreaming? That's the premis of the Christmas Special this year.

Dream-crab aliens have suckered themselves onto the Doctor, Clara and several other people and pulled them into a shared dream experience.
As the episode unfolds, the group realise they are in dreams within dreams and can't be sure whether or not they have actually woken or are still
caught up in another dream. So how do they know they're still dreaming? Well, do you believe in Santa Claus? Santa pops up on Christmas Eve in the North Pole
(where the episode is set) with two helper elves in order to save the day (or night as it were). And since Santa re-appears every time the group 
"wakes up", well, they can't actually be awake can they? It was inevitable that a Christmas episode would eventually feature Santa and I thought 
it worked pretty well. This Santa was witty ("how do you fit all the presents on the sleigh"..."it's bigger on the inside")

As you'll remember from the series finale, The Doctor and Clara both lied to each other about finding Gallifrey and Danny's return. In this 
episode the truth comes out and they acknowledge that Gallifrey was not found and Danny did not return. Which opens the way for Clara to continue 
travelling with the Doctor since she no longer has Danny as a reason to stay behind. The highlight of the epsiode for me were the scenes with old-Clara. 
The Doctor travels to Clara to remove the dream crab but travels too far into the future when Clara is in her 80s. The scenes between the Doctor 
and Clara were so tender and the Doctor was so gentle, it was so sweet to see them interact. In a way, it would have been a great ending for Clara 
but of course, it was just a dream. Clara will be joing the Doctor in the TARDIS for Series 9.
