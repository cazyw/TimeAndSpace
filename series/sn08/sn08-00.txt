Introduction

A New New New Doctor. Gallifrey lives! The 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary special in 2013 brought with it the startling news 
that Gallifrey was not destroyed in the Time War but locked away outside time and space (in 'cup-a-soup"). This was further mentioned 
in the 11<sup>th</sup> Doctor's finale "The Time of the Doctor", where it was revealed that the Timelords were calling through the cracks in 
the universe. Interestingly although the Doctor knows he saved Gallifrey, this season will herald a darker Doctor. But the 12<sup>th</sup>
Doctor is no stranger to the Whoniverse, having appeared in both the Series 4 episode "The Fires of Pompeii" and Torchwood's "Miracle Day".
We already know that this was no coincidence so how will Steven Moffat explain these appearances?! 
Series 8 also brought with it a new title sequence. To be honest the first title sequence in the new series is still my favourite.
Simple, with a sort of traditional orchestral theme track. The title sequences in the Moffat era have been more elaborate. Change can be good but 
sometimes it feels like they've just thrown random cool ideas together. I do think it's nice that they've based the current visual sequence on 
a very impressive sequence made by a fan (although to be honest I think the fan-made one was better). 

So, what's in store for this 2000+ year old Timelord? We have 12 weeks of adventuring to find out...
