Concluding Thoughts

Overall I really liked series 9, more so than series 8. I thought the double episodes worked well and hark back to the classic era where multi-episode arcs were common. The two-parters allowed a deeper exploration of one-off characters and more empathy towards them as it hasn't been just running around saving the day, there's been time for more meaningful dialogue. We had the terrific and very relevant to our times Zygon episodes, and there have been deeper themes explored this year - war, immortality, choices, consequences and morality. There have been a lot more ripples with events in past or present episodes affecting present and future episodes. But the Doctor has also been a lot of fun and more light-hearted this series with his shades, electric guitar and jokes. For me this has been one of the most enjoyable series in the new series and I think the Doctor has been well balanced. He reminds me of the ninth Doctor, who was my first and still holds the place as my favourite Doctor - northern angry gruffness mixed with child-like joy and awe of the universe. Only now, it's Scottish gruffness (which is even further north!).
