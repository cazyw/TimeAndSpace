Introduction

And so begins the second series with the Twelfth Doctor who will be accompanied by Clara in her (confirmed) final year in the TARDIS. While the storylines last year were a little bit hit and miss, this Doctor has grown on me and watching him play opposite Missy (The Master) was a hoot. Great dynamic. With the exit of Danny Pink and the return of Missy, I'm looking forward to what's coming this series. From what we know, there will be more two-part episodes which will allow more in-depth storylines.
